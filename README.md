# Hello World/Test Programs

Hi, this is devcyan here! I am collecting all of my test and "hello world" type programs here for those new to programming/scripting to reference, use, and expand upon as they will.

I'm nowhere near an expert. In fact, I'm quite new to non-interpretted languages. This project was started for me to find the programming languages that fit me best.

Good luck in your coding endeavors and don't forget to comment your code!
